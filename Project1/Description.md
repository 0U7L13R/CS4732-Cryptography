This project implements the Vigen√®re cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages. It prompts the user for a plaintext string and a key, sanitizes both inputs by removing non-alphabetic characters and converting to lowercase, then encrypts the plaintext using the key. The program also decrypts the ciphertext back to the original message using the same key and displays both the encrypted and decrypted results.
