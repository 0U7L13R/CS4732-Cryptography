# Chapter 1 – Computer and Network Security Concepts

## Introduction

Computer security is the discipline focused on protecting systems and data from a wide range of threats and vulnerabilities. Its purpose is to ensure the reliable and secure functioning of information systems and the protection of digital assets.

The three core principles of computer security are:

- **Confidentiality** – Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. This prevents sensitive data from being disclosed to unauthorized individuals or systems.
- **Integrity** – Ensures that information is accurate and complete, and that it has not been altered in an unauthorized manner. Integrity includes mechanisms to detect and correct unauthorized modifications.
- **Availability** – Ensures that information and critical services are accessible when needed. A system that is down or slow may effectively deny access, which can be as damaging as a breach of confidentiality.

According to NIST:

> “The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources.”

These information system resources include:
- **Hardware** – physical components like servers, routers, and computers.
- **Software** – operating systems, applications, and utilities.
- **Firmware** – embedded code in devices.
- **Data** – both structured and unstructured.
- **Telecommunications** – the infrastructure that connects systems and facilitates communication.

## Objectives of Computer Security

1. **Confidentiality** – Prevent unauthorized parties from accessing sensitive or private data. This involves encryption, access controls, and secure communication protocols.
2. **Integrity** – Protect data from unauthorized changes, ensuring the information is trustworthy. Techniques include hashing, digital signatures, and checksums.
3. **Availability** – Ensure systems remain operational and accessible. Techniques include fault tolerance, redundancy, and protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

## Breach Impact Levels

- **Low** – Minor damage. Affects non-critical systems or results in temporary inconvenience.
- **Moderate** – Noticeable disruption. Impacts business operations or user trust.
- **High** – Severe consequences. May include loss of life (e.g., healthcare systems), massive financial loss, or legal/regulatory consequences.

## Security Challenges

- Security is inherently complex due to ever-changing threats and evolving technologies.
- Systems are often only as secure as their weakest component.
- The cost and effort of security may not be appreciated until a failure occurs.
- Good security may reduce convenience or usability, causing resistance from users.
- Effective protection must address both known vulnerabilities and anticipate emerging threats.

Additional issues include:
- Insider threats from employees or partners.
- Balancing performance, usability, and security.
- Keeping up with patches and updates.
- The arms race between attackers and defenders.

## OSI Security Architecture

The OSI architecture provides a conceptual framework for implementing security in systems.

**Definitions:**
- **Security Attack** – Any attempt to breach security policies by gaining unauthorized access to information or disrupting services.
- **Security Mechanism** – Tools or techniques (e.g., firewalls, encryption, authentication) used to detect, prevent, or recover from attacks.
- **Security Service** – Functions that provide a certain level of protection (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) to data or systems.

## Types of Security Attacks

### 1. Passive Attacks

These involve monitoring or eavesdropping on transmissions. They do not alter system data but violate confidentiality.

- **Release of message contents** – Intercepting sensitive data such as emails or login credentials.
- **Traffic analysis** – Observing communication patterns (e.g., frequency, timing) to infer information.

Countermeasures include strong encryption and traffic padding.

### 2. Active Attacks

These involve modifying or disrupting data or operations. They can be harder to prevent and more damaging.

- **Modification of messages** – Altering content in transit.
- **Masquerade** – Impersonating another user or system.
- **Replay** – Reusing old transmissions to gain unauthorized access.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** – Overloading a system to prevent legitimate access.

Defenses include integrity checks, authentication, and intrusion detection systems.

## Security Services (from X.800 & RFC 4949)

1. **Authentication** – Verifies the identity of communicating parties. Can include single-factor (passwords) or multi-factor (tokens, biometrics) methods.
2. **Access Control** – Enforces rules on who can access what resources. Policies can be based on roles, attributes, or user identities.
3. **Data Confidentiality** – Prevents unauthorized access to information. Usually achieved via encryption.
4. **Data Integrity** – Detects and prevents unauthorized data modification. Hashing and digital signatures are key mechanisms.
5. **Nonrepudiation** – Ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a message or a transaction.
6. **Availability** – Keeps services operational and resilient to disruption or attacks.

## Security Mechanisms (X.800)

Mechanisms include:
- **Encipherment** – Transforming data into an unreadable format using encryption.
- **Digital Signatures** – Verifying authenticity and integrity of a message.
- **Access Controls** – Managing permissions for users and systems.
- **Authentication Exchange** – Verifying identities during communication.
- **Traffic Padding** – Making all messages the same size to prevent traffic analysis.
- **Routing Control** – Ensuring data takes secure paths.
- **Notarization** – Using trusted third parties to validate actions.

## Fundamental Security Design Principles

1. **Economy of Mechanism** – Keep designs simple to reduce errors and make them easier to audit and secure.
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults** – Default settings should deny access; permissions must be explicitly granted.
3. **Complete Mediation** – Every access request must be validated against the current security policy.
4. **Open Design** – Security should not rely on secrecy of design. Algorithms should be public; secrecy should lie in keys.
5. **Separation of Privilege** – Require multiple conditions for access, improving robustness.
6. **Least Privilege** – Users should only have access to the resources they need to do their job.
7. **Least Common Mechanism** – Minimize shared resources to reduce risk of unintended interactions or data leakage.
8. **Psychological Acceptability** – Security features should not burden users excessively; they should be intuitive and minimally disruptive.
9. **Isolation** – Separate critical components to contain breaches and limit exposure.
10. **Encapsulation** – Restrict access to internal workings of systems via defined interfaces.
11. **Modularity** – Build security in isolated, interchangeable components that can be tested independently.
12. **Layering** – Use multiple, overlapping defenses so that failure of one does not compromise the system.
13. **Least Astonishment** – System behavior should align with user expectations to prevent misuse or confusion.

## Attack Surfaces

The attack surface of a system includes all points where an attacker could try to exploit a vulnerability. A smaller, more controlled attack surface improves security.

### 3 Main Categories:
1. **Network Attack Surface** – Exposed services, open ports, and network protocols.
2. **Software Attack Surface** – Application bugs, insecure libraries, and poorly implemented features.
3. **Human Attack Surface** – Social engineering, phishing, or insider threats.

Attack surfaces should be regularly assessed and minimized.

## Attack Trees

An attack tree is a structured way to model potential security breaches.

- The **root** represents the attacker’s goal.
- **Branches** show different paths or strategies to reach that goal.
- **Leaf nodes** are individual steps or exploits.

Attack trees help identify weaknesses, prioritize defenses, and simulate attacker behavior.

## Network Security Models

### 1. Model for Network Security

Describes communication between a sender and a receiver through a potentially insecure channel.

- Threats include interception, tampering, and forgery.
- Defenses include encryption (to ensure confidentiality), integrity checks (to detect changes), and authentication (to verify identity).

### 2. Network Access Security Model

Focuses on securing access to the network itself before any communication begins.

- Defends against unauthorized users or devices joining the network.
- Tools include firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), authentication protocols, and intrusion prevention systems.

## Unwanted Access & Threats

Malicious software or unauthorized code may compromise system integrity and availability.

### Two main types:
- **Information Access Threats** – Stealing or intercepting sensitive data.
- **Service Threats** – Disabling or disrupting services, often using flaws in applications or infrastructure.

Common vectors include:
- Malicious attachments or downloads
- Vulnerabilities in trusted programs (e.g., compilers, editors)

## Security Standards

Organizations rely on established standards to guide their security practices:

- **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology) provides detailed guidelines (e.g., NIST SP 800 series).
- **ISO/IEC 27001** is a globally recognized framework for managing information security.
- **RFCs (Request for Comments)** like RFC 4949 define security terminology and best practices.

Standards help ensure consistency, interoperability, and regulatory compliance.
